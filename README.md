**The objective of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of global CO2 emissions spanning from 1970 to 2021 and answer following key questions:** 

- The annual percent change from 1970 to 2021.
- Trend of global emissions per year during same period.
- Identify top 5 countries with highest emission in any given year?
- The percentage breakdown of CO2 emission from Coal, Oil and Gas?


To achieve the project objective, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset of global CO2 emissions available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022). This project involved using Microsoft Excel to analyze the data and derive meaningful insights. The findings of this project have significant implications for policymakers, environmentalists, and other stakeholders concerned with climate change and its impact on the planet. Overall, this project provides a valuable contribution to the field of environmental research by shedding light on global CO2 emissions.
